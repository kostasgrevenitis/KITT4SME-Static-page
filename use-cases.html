                    namely motor, chassis, and wheels. Each line is staffed by 1 to 10 workers,
                    depending on the changing production demand and each worker can work in each of the 3 lines.</p>

                <p class="lead">The COO, Jane Doe, has decided to take care of the challenge above.
                    However, the method of identifying the most tiring work cells and shifts, is very
                    prone to biased results: asking it to the workers will not reveal it, since the workers will be
                    tending to
                    claim that “their work cell is the most critical and the tiring one” and manually observing the work
                    cells
                    will lead
                    to subjective assessment of the observer. Besides, the method should reveal the identity of the
                    worker,
                    leading to a discrimination or an unfair assessment of the worker based on their fatigue levels.</p>

                <p class="lead">To get to the root of the problem, Jane wants to identify the most critical work cells
                    that leads to high
                    level of fatigue and low ergonomic level together and the most tiring shifts due to factors like the
                    workload,
                    timing, and intensity of the work, so to prioritize the most tiring work cells and shifts and to
                    implement
                    better ergonomic practices, investing in more comfortable equipment and tools, and scheduling breaks
                    to give
                    workers time to recharge. </p>

                        Jane is undertaking an initiative to address the well-being concerns impacting her company, and
                        she seeks a
                        solution or a composition of solutions (kits) that is affordable and user-friendly. In her
                        search for
                        potential solutions, Jane is interested in exploring AI-based solutions or composition of them.
                        As a result,
                        she searches for “AI kits for SMEs” and discovers KITT4SME, which ranks among the top results of
                        her Google
                        search.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">The outcome was a kit suggestion that includes FaMS, IM and the Sensing Layer. Jane,
                        after a discussion with
                        the Platform Manager, decided to deploy the kit. They arrange a visit to the company to
                        integrate the solution
                        into the company’s systems, train their personnel on how to use it, and they activate the kit.
                        Once the kit
                        has been activated, they conduct tests to ensure that data acquisition, extraction, synthesis,
                        and reporting
                        are functioning properly.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Once the integration and testing are complete, the solution provider leaves the company and
                        receive the
                        payment from KITT4SME after Jane approves that they have received the goods and services they
                        have purchased.
                        Each worker is equipped with wearable devices that collect his or her data, based on which the
                        worker's
                        fatigue is estimated. For privacy issues, it is not possible to visualize the information (and
                        thus the
                        fatigue) of the individual worker: only the values of average fatigue and number of workers for
                        each line are
                        known. Using the FaMS and the Sensing Layer, the dashboard displays the average fatigue level of
                        each line,
                        which is stored in the platform, ready to be fetched by IM.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Since the number of workers in the lines is constantly changing (workers going to
                        and from break, workers
                        starting or finishing their shifts), as well as the average perceived fatigue of the workers
                        (depending on the
                        number of operations they are
                        performing and the time they are working), unbalanced situations will arise in which some lines
                        will have more
                        workers than needed and consequently different average levels of fatigue.
                        Using the IM, the system reassigns the workers in two possible ways: </p>

                    <p class="lead">For the Company X, the problem of identifying the most tiring work cells has been
                        resolved: biased
                        results based on the subjective opinion of the workers is avoided, yet the privacy of the
                        workers is
                        completely
                        ensured.</p>

                    <p class="lead">With the dynamic job allocation based on the real-time fatigue values, the
                        improvements began to take effect
                        over time. Retaking the survey for the worker wellbeing and physical stress (NASA TLX and Borg
                        CR), Jane’s
                        workers reported feeling less fatigued and more energized, leading to higher levels of
                        productivity and job
                        satisfaction. In the long term, the high turnover rate was also reduced, as employees were more
                        likely to stay
                        in their roles and have higher job satisfaction. Jane realized that it was important not only to
                        identify
                        problems in the workplace, but to take action to solve them. By prioritizing the well-being of
                        his workers,
                        she
                        was able to create a more positive work environment, leading to better results for both the
                        employees and the
                        factory. The workers are happy that their work is more balanced, and their fatigue levels are
                        being monitored.
                        The company is now considering using KITT4SME as a one-stop-shop to improve their productivity.

                </p>

                <p class="lead">The company recently went under a change in the products, by shifting from the
                    manufacturing of lead
                    batteries to Li-Ion batteries. Despite the big investment in the shopfloor and recently hired
                    experienced
                    personnel, the
                    workers are now struggling to adapt to new processes and working methods which leads to increasing
                    quality
                    issues and high level of scraps. </p>

                <p class="lead"><strong>Max Mustermann, the Quality Manager</strong>, has identified one process, the
                    sealing of
                    the battery, which is done with a special machine that the company have bought for the new
                    batteries. For the
                    quality control, a person manually checks the defects only in a small number of batteries, and the
                    whole batch
                    is considered OK when there were no defects seen in the checked batteries. It’s common that the
                    worker finds
                    some problems in the batch, which are mainly related with the welding spots, and interests not a
                    small number
                    of batteries.</p>

                <p class="lead">To decrease the quality issues, Max decides to collect data manually from each
                    production line, but this
                    takes a lot of time, since the company lack of sensors for data collection at the time. In addition,
                    the large
                    amount
                    of data collected was relatively useless due to the difficulty in understanding correlations between
                    the
                    collected data of different operations. Max also considers sending the workers to some trainings,
                    hoping the
                    upskilling
                    the quality workers will help to decrease the quality issues, however, but the workers need guidance
                    on
                    finding the right courses, and the HR is continuously asking the quality department to deliver them
                    a list of
                    trainings they wish to receive within their training budget.</p>

                    Max is determined to address the issues plaguing the company. Despite not being certain of the root
                    cause of
                    the problem, he embarks on a search for a cost-effective solution that can resolve his problem.
                    While he was
                    browsing through LinkedIn, he discovers the success story of detecting the shop-floor anomalies with
                    SADS in
                    KITT4SME, which proposes a very specific module. Intrigued, he uses the link to access the success
                    story, and
                    to the registration page of KITT4SME, and eventually find himself in RAMP, where he was asked to
                    register with
                    his company email and company information.

                        identified the AI module he
                        wants to use; therefore he opts out using the Adaptive Questionnaire. As a customer redirected

                        a dialog Box
                        and discovers that SADS and a combination of some connectors is the right solution for his
                        needs. With the
                        KITT4SME Representative, Max is convinced to purchase the composed kit.</p>

                        user sends the configuration to the Module Manager for implementability analysis. The RAMP
                        Integrator reviews
                        the configuration, confirms the price and implementability of the solution. Once the payment is

                        the RAMP Integrator deploys the solution to the KITT4SME platform.</p>

                        company’s systems, train personnel on how to use it, and activate the kit. Once the kit has been
                        activated,
                        they conduct tests to ensure that data acquisition, extraction, synthesis, and reporting are
                        functioning

                        the company and receive payment from KITT4SME after approval has been obtained from Max.
                        Using the SADS and the Sensing Layer , the system monitors the batteries welding spots after the
                        sealing
                        process.

                        manufacturing company has
                        resulted in gaining a new customer and collaborating with a solution provider. This has also
                        encouraged them to
                        utilize KITT4SME as a sales channel for their products.</p>

                    <p class="lead">For KITT4SME, the sale has resulted in a commission and a satisfied customer and
                        suppliers, which highlights the
                        benefits of using KITT4SME as a platform for business transactions.</p>
