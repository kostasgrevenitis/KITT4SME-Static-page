          SMEs)
          specifically targets European SMEs and mid-caps to provide them with scope-tailored and industry-ready
          hardware, software and organisational kits, delivered as modularly customisable digital platform, that
          seamlessly introduce artificial intelligence in their production systems.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4 my-3">
          Uptake of the resulting packages and of the provided devices is strongly supported by the clear
          characterisation and market readiness of the individual components as well as by the platform grounding on the
          already established RAMP Marketplace. Leverage on the network of Digital Innovation Hubs, three of which are
          represented in the consortium, ensure that KITT4SME are widely distributed to a wide audience of companies in
          Europe. Seamless adoption of the customised kits is made possible by a Powered by FIWARE infrastructure that
          flawlessly combine Factory systems (such as MES and ERP), IoT sensors and wearable devices, robots,
          collaborative robots and other Factory data sources with functional modules capable to trigger data-driven
          value creation.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4 my-3">
          The KITT4SME concept comes into being from the acknowledge that companies are unprepared and inadequately
          exposed to extremely complex and widely diverse digital solutions in the field of artificial intelligence that
          are often much too broad in scope and relentless in dictating their own objectives instead of focusing on the
          issues a company really faces. Yet, whereas big companies have capitals and resources to research and build
          platforms internally, SMEs struggle in finding solutions that are fitting to their needs and, even when
          exposed to them, have to bear significant financial risks to embrace them while lacking the competences for a
          first-right selection. Lag in the digitisation race for them is not a system by-product it is a designed
          feature.
