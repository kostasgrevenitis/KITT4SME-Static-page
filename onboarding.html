                    through a set of multiple choice questions and get, at the end, the list of issues.
                    As soon as you have answered all the questions of the Adaptive Questionnaire you will be asked to

                    RAMP (Robotics and Automation Marketplace) is an online marketplace intended to create a
                    bridge between the manufacturing end users and the solution providers. RAMP makes more effective the
                    artificial intelligence and automation value chain for the manufacturing industry. It provides an
                    open platform for manufacturing end users and solutions providers, thus promoting dynamic
                    networking and interactions between the users. KITT4SME is one of the components of the RAMP and the
                    solutions of the granted open call applicants will be offered through RAMP.

                <p class="lead">
                    RAMP helps cutting costs and reducing the knowledge and access gap between the manufacturing end
                    users of AI and robotics & automation in multiple ways. Among others, it consolidates all value
                    chain actors in one place, allowing them to find faster the best solution. Having the needed
                    relevant information of the providers easily accessible, and by reading their previous customersâ€™
                    comments and feedback, it is easier to compare different offers and providers. Additional online
                    tools facilitate online co-creation of solutions, further cutting the initial phase costs and
                    reducing the planning time.

                <p class="lead">
                    On the other hand, solution providers gain access to a new international market and business
                    opportunities. Manufacturing end users can now find them faster, while it is easier to communicate
                    with more potential customers and gain insight on their needs. Lastly, RAMP collects open
                    digitisation platforms and community support
